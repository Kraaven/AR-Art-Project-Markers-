# Scanning Art

As a part of the AR mobile pathway i am doing on the Unity learn Platform, i have to submit a project regarding the theme (Art). This project was made for that reason


## Note

- Uses a piece of art as the scanned image
- Renders a running wolf on a slowly rotating platform on top of the wolf Painting
- There is a Mute button for the music in the background
